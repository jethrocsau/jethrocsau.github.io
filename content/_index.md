       AI/ML driven interventions against drug and therapeutic resistant pathogens and cancer cells. 

        Along with my obsession with AI, I also spend my time building ventures for healthcare companies such as building medical devices using cationic polymers effective against MDROs, drug-discovery with generative AI, and infection surveillance systems!
