publication: AlbumGen - Image-to-Music Generation with Textual Intermediaries
publication_short:
abstract: This project explores the intersection of computer vision and music generation by utilizing image captioning models on album cover art and employing text-to-music generation models, such as MusicGen, to create music based on these captions. By training a model to generate descriptive captions from album covers, we aim to develop a system that automatically produces music aligned with the visual themes of album artwork. This innovative approach opens new avenues for creative AI-assisted music production.
